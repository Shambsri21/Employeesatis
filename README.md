## Key Features

-   **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Tools and examples for handling raw employee satisfaction datasets.

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Jupyter Notebooks designed for initial data insights and understanding distributions.

-   **Data Visualization**: Utilizes popular Python libraries to create informative charts and graphs.

-   **Statistical Analysis**: Framework for applying statistical methods to identify key drivers of satisfaction.

-   **Interactive Environment**: Leverages Jupyter Notebook for an interactive and iterative analysis workflow.

## Architecture Overview

This project is structured around a single Jupyter Notebook, serving as the primary environment for data analysis. It follows a typical data science workflow: data ingestion, cleaning, exploratory data analysis, visualization, and potentially statistical modeling. All code execution and output are contained within the notebook, making it a self-contained and reproducible analysis environment. Data files are expected to reside locally, ideally within a dedicated `data/` directory.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

-   Python 3.8+

-   `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shambsri21/Employeesatis.git

cd Employeesatis

```
2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

```bash
python -m venv venv

```
3.  **Activate the virtual environment:**

    -   On macOS/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate

```
-   On Windows:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate

```
4.  **Install the required Python packages:**

```bash
pip install jupyter pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

```

## Configuration

This project does not rely on external environment variables for configuration. All necessary paths (e.g., for data files) are expected to be defined directly within the Jupyter Notebook.

- --

## Usage

To run the analysis and explore the employee satisfaction data:

1.  **Ensure your virtual environment is activated.**

2.  **Start the Jupyter Notebook server:**

```bash
jupyter notebook

```
3.  **Open the Notebook:**
    Your web browser should automatically open to the Jupyter dashboard. Navigate to and click on `employee_satisfaction_analysis.ipynb` (or similar name if the main notebook file is different) to open the notebook.

4.  **Run the cells:**
    Execute the cells sequentially within the notebook to perform data loading, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. You can run cells by selecting them and pressing `Shift + Enter`.

## Roadmap

-   [ ] Add more detailed comments and explanations within the Jupyter Notebook.

-   [ ] Incorporate advanced statistical models or machine learning algorithms for predictive analysis.

-   [ ] Explore interactive visualization libraries (e.g., Plotly, Bokeh).

-   [ ] Create a sample dataset for easier replication and testing.

-   [ ] Refactor notebook cells for better modularity and readability.

## Testing

Given the nature of a Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, "testing" primarily involves:

-   **Manual Verification**: Visually inspecting outputs, plots, and summary statistics to ensure they align with expectations and data characteristics.

-   **Data Integrity Checks**: Implementing assertions or checks within the notebook to ensure data types, missing values, and ranges are as expected after preprocessing steps.

-   **Reproducibility**: Ensuring that running the notebook from top to bottom consistently produces the same results.
